Advent of Code 2020
===================

## Day 1

### Part 1

Find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:

1721
979
366
299
675
1456

In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299.
Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.

Of course, your expense report is much larger.
Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?

### Part 2

Find the three entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?

## Day 2

### Part 1

Their password database seems to be a little corrupted:
some of the passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the Official Toboggan Corporate Policy that was in effect when they were chosen.

To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input)
of passwords (according to the corrupted database)
and the corporate policy when that password was set.

For example, suppose you have the following list:

1-3 a: abcde
1-3 b: cdefg
2-9 c: ccccccccc

Each line gives the password policy and then the password.
The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid.
For example, 1-3 a means that the password must contain `a` at least 1 time and at most 3 times.

In the above example, 2 passwords are valid.
The middle password, cdefg, is not; it contains no instances of b, but needs at least 1.
The first and third passwords are valid: they contain one a or nine c, both within the limits of their respective policies.

How many passwords are valid according to their policies?
